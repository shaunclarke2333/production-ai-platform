# # The idea here is:
# # create a user
# # create a group
# # add the user to the group
# # create a role with a trust relationship that allows the user to assume the role
# # create a policy that allows the user to assume the role 
# # attach the assume role policy to the group
# # create an AWS side policy that allows the user to discover and connect to the EKS cluster
# # attach the AWS side policy to the group and the role
# # Bind the role that can be assumed by the user to a group in kubernetes that RBAC permissions to the cluster.
# # This allows the user to connect to the cluster and be permitted to do whatever the permissions on that group in kubernetes is allowed to do.

# # Configuring the AWS CLI for the user to be able to assume the role and connect to the cluster is outside the scope of this terraform code, but it can be done by running the following command in the terminal:
# # aws configure set role_arn arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:role/<role_name> --profile <profile_name>
# # Then the user can use the profile to connect to the cluster using kubectl by running:
# # aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name> --region <region> --profile <profile_name>
# # Step 1: Configure base IAM user credentials (one-time setup)
# # aws configure --profile developer

# # Step 2: Add role-based profile (edit AWS config file)
# # Open config file:
# # vi ~/.aws/config
# #
# # Add the following:
# # [profile eks-developer]
# # role_arn = arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<eks-developer-role-name> # The role that the user will assume to access the EKS cluster. This role should have the necessary permissions to access the cluster and should be created in the terraform code above.
# # source_profile = developer # The profile with the base credentials that has permissions to assume the role. This is usually the default profile or a profile created for this purpose.
# # region = us-west-2

# # Step 3: Verify role assumption (should return assumed-role ARN)
# # aws sts get-caller-identity --profile eks-developer

# # Step 4: Configure kubeconfig to use the assumed role
# # aws eks update-kubeconfig \
# #   --region us-west-2 \
# #   --name <cluster-name> \
# #   --profile eks-developer
